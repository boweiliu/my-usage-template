"""Your own usage data: what the workspace's analytics copy holds, with activity per day, chats, apps and the original records behind each number..

Services run from /home/user/workspace (the repo root). Conventions:

- Persistent state (anything written and read across runs -- cursors,
  caches, snapshots, user records): read and write it under ``DATA_DIR``
  (defined below), never a hardcoded ``data/.apps/my-usage/`` at the
  call site. ``DATA_DIR`` defaults to ``data/.apps/my-usage/`` but
  honors the ``MY_USAGE_DATA_DIR`` env var, so an editing agent can point a
  throwaway instance at a *copy* of the data instead of the live store
  (see the update-app skill). Do NOT use ``Path(__file__)``-based
  paths for state -- the bug to avoid is one process writing to
  ``/home/user/workspace/data/.apps/...`` while another reads from
  ``/home/user/workspace/system/apps/<pkg>/data/...``.
- Static assets shipped alongside this file (templates, default
  configs, bundled JSON): ``Path(__file__).parent / "assets/..."`` is
  fine and is the right pattern.
- Listen port: bind ``PORT`` (defined below), which defaults to this
  app's assigned port but honors the ``MY_USAGE_PORT`` env var, so
  an editing agent can boot a throwaway instance on a *spare* port
  alongside the live one (see the update-app skill). Never hardcode
  the port at the ``run_simple`` call.

This is a synchronous Flask app served by the threaded Werkzeug server.
The app owns its own browser origin (the forwarder routes
``http://my-usage.<workspace-host>/`` straight to this port), so it serves
at ``/`` and root-absolute URLs, cookies, and service workers all work
unmodified -- nothing rewrites anything. Use ``flask_sock`` if you need
WebSockets.
